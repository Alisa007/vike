## Vike Extension

<UseUiFrameworkVikeExtensionHint uiFrameworkName="Solid" noQuote={true} />

## Manual Integration

Instead of using a Vike extension, you can manually integrate Solid yourself, giving you full control over the integration of not only Solid itself but also Solid libraries.

Official example:
 - [`vike-solid` source code](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-solid/tree/main/vike-solid) - Full-featured integeration.

Community examples:

 - <Example timestamp="2023.10" repo="brillout/vike-with-solid-spa" /> - Solid + SPA + Server Routing.
 - <Example timestamp="2023.06" repo="inlang/monorepo" /> - Source code of [`inlang.com`](https://inlang.com/) which is built with Vike and Solid.
 - <Example timestamp="2023.02" repo="vchirikov/vite-plugin-ssr-solidjs-blog-example" /> - Homepage + Blog example.
   > vite-plugin-ssr was the [previous name of Vike](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/vike).
