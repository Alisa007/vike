In development:

- Don't set `process.env.NODE_ENV`, or set it to one of the following values: `['development', 'dev', '', undefined]`.
- If you use a sever, then add Vite's server middleware. (See <Link href="/renderPage#usage" />.)

In production (and staging):

- Don't set `process.env.NODE_ENV` (Vike sets it to `'production'` if it's `undefined`), or set it to a value different than `['development', 'dev', '', undefined]`, for example `'production'` or `'staging'`.
- If you use a server, make sure you don't add Vite's server middleware: it isn't needed in production and would unnecessarily bloat your production server.

> `process.env.NODE_ENV` is a widespread convention that many tools use to determine whether your app is running in production or development.
>
> It's important to respect that convention as may tools will otherwise misbehave (such as React).

> While the `process.env.NODE_ENV` convention was introduced by Node.js, it's used by tools regardless of whether you use Node.js or not. Thus make sure to follow the convention even in non-Node.js environments.
