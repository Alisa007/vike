In development:

- Don't set `process.env.NODE_ENV`, or set it to one of the following values: `['development', 'dev', '', undefined]`.
- If you use a sever, add Vite's middleware to your server. (As shown in <Link href="/renderPage#usage" />.)

In production (and staging):

- Set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to a value different than `['development', 'dev', '', undefined]`, for example `'production'` or `'staging'`.
- If you use a server, make sure you don't add Vite's middleware to your server: it isn't needed in production and would unnecessarily bloat your production server.

> `process.env.NODE_ENV` is a widespread convention that many tools use to determine whether your app is running in production or development.
>
> It's important to respect that convention as may tools, such as React, will otherwise misbehave.

> While the convention was introduced by Node.js, it's used by tools regardless of whether you use Node.js or not. Thus make sure to properly set `process.env.NODE_ENV` also in non-Node.js environments.
