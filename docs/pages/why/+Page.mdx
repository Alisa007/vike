## Optional Control

A core belief of Vike is what we call optional control: you begin with a full-fledged zero-config setup to quickly get started, while later as you scale and as the need arises you take control over integration code that was initially hidden from you.

You can for example use <Link href="/extensions">`vike-react`</Link> to get a quick start similar to Next.js while later replacing `vike-react` with a fully custom React integration.

If you use Vike without any Vike extension then you have complete control over how your favorite tools integrate with Vike.

> Vike extensions use the same interface as Vike applications: anything a Vike extension can do, you as a Vike user can do as well. In other words, Vike extensions are fully ejectable.

With Vike, you get the best of both words: a quick start as well as control.

You can double down on the [Lean Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) methodology:
1. Quickly ship a prototype/[MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) in order to quickly get your first users.
1. Quickly get feedback about what users want.
1. As you grow: focus, take control over, and polish features that make your app unique to your users.

For example:
- While <Link href="/RPC">RPC</Link> is an excellent choice to quickly get started, you usually need GraphQL if you scale to a larger organization.
  > Vike is unique in the sense that it allows you to have complete control over the GraphQL integration. (But you can also use a Vike extension such as `vike-react-apollo` to quickly get started with GraphQL.)
- If <Link href="/i18n">i18n</Link> becomes a central part of your app, then you can use Vike's low-level hooks to have complete control over how you internationalize your app.
  > Vike's flexibility is unique as well for i18n.
- If your authentication strategy becomes an important aspect of your app, then you can eject your Vike extension for authentication and take full control over the authentication process.
  > Vike extensions such as `vike-authjs` and `vike-lucia` are work-in-progress.
