import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'
import { HeaderFileIntro } from '../../components'


## Transform

<HeaderFileIntro />


## Why

Consider this example:

```js
// +config.h.js

// onRenderClient() should be loaded only on the client-side
import onRenderClient from './some-file'
// onRenderHtml() should be loaded only on the server-side
import onRenderHtml from './some-other-file'

export default { onRenderHtml, onRenderClient }
```

The <Link href="#transform">`.h.js` transformation</Link> enables Vike to load the hooks `onRenderClient()` and `onRenderHtml()` in the right environment.


## Runtime code

Runtime code cannot live inside `+config.h.js` files.

```js
// +config.h.js

// ❌ The runtime code of Page and data cannot live here.
export default {
  Page() {
    // ...
  },
  data() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Vike throws:
```
[Wrong Usage] The code of Page cannot live inside +config.h.js
```

Instead, runtime code always needs to be imported:

```js
// +config.h.js

import Page from './some-file'
import data from './some-other-file'

export default { Page, data }
```

> Importing runtime code works because <Link href="#transform">Vike transforms `.h.js`</Link> files.


## Not re-exported imports

If an import isn't re-exported then it won't be included in any runtime:

```js
// +config.h.js

import { something } from './some-file'
// CSS imports don't have any effect here. You should import CSS files in runtime code
// such as +Page.js instead.
import './some.css'

// These logs are printed only when Vike reads +config.h.js files (at development and when
// building your app). The logs aren't included in the client runtime nor server runtime.
// Consequently, you won't see these logs in production.
console.log(something) // Prints: 'import:./some-file:something'
console.log("I will never be shown in production")

export default {
  // The import something isn't re-exported and, therefore, the
  // code defined in some-file.js isn't included in any runtime.
}
```

The server and client runtimes don't include code defined inside `+config.h.js` files: they only include the code of re-exported imports.
