Vike differs from Next.js in three fundamental ways:
 1. Vike is UI Framework agnostic.
    > Vike is completely agnostic to React and its source code has zero dependency on React. You can actually use Vike with any other UI Framework (Vue, Preact, Solid, etc.).
    >
    > With Vike, you implement and fully control the React integration, which has many benefits. For example, you can use Relay in the same way that Facebook does (with a render-as-you-fetch stream) which isn't possible with Next.js.
 1. Vike is server and deployment agnostic.
    > With Vike, you keep full control over your server and you can use any deployment strategy.
 1. Vike is full-fledged yet minimal.
    > [All dependencies](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/blob/89073c8375d46af7cc05057a8f2efcd833273be6/vike/package.json#L4-L13) are either shared with Vite (e.g. [`fast-glob`](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob)) or fully/transitively owned (e.g. [`@brillout/json-serializer`](https://github.com/brillout/json-serializer)). Adding Vike to your Vite app doesn't add any frivolous dependency.
    >
    > We believe Vike hits the sweet spot of being a full-fledged frontend tool while avoiding unnecessary bells and whistles.

Beyond these structural differences,
Vike introduces features such as blazing fast HMR (powered by Vite), first-class SPA support, Domain-driven File Structure, state-of-the-art Code Splitting (powered by Vite/Rollup), Automatic Deployment Synchronization, [Build Your Own Framework](https://vike.land), etc.

> Turbopack replicates some of Vite's techniques, but it's still in its infancy and it will take a while until Turbopack is production-ready. With Vite, you can use lightning fast DX today.

Finally, Vike is a community project: instead of leaning on a framework with business interests that are fundamentally at odds with yours, use a community-driven project that is sponsored by, made for, and made from the community.


## UI Framework agnostic

With Vike, you can integrate React yourself. This means you need to write a little bit more boilerplate, but in exchange you get a lot more flexibility.
You can even use [vike-react](https://vike.dev/react) to do it for you, and later when you need more control you can eject.

Because you can control the React integration, you also have full control over the frontend integration of your favorite tools (data fetching, state management, authentication, etc.).

For example, you can use Relay and Apollo in ways that aren't possible with Next.js.

> Relay is a state-of-the-art GraphQL client developed and used at scale by Facebook (which invented GraphQL). The [YouTube video "Re-introducing Relay"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhVGdErZuN4) explains in detail the benefits of Relay.
>
> Many users and sponsors leverage Vike's flexibility to integrate Relay with SSR Streaming.

Apart from allowing you to use any rendering library, Vike includes everything you'd expect from a frontend framework: Client-side Routing, HMR, Filesystem Routing, Pre-rendering, Data Fetching, Code Splitting, Layouts, i18n, etc.


## Server/deployment agnostic

### Next.js

Next.js is made by [Vercel](https://vercel.com), a serverless hosting provider. It is therefore naturally optimised to run in their environment and infrastructure. But Vercel is [known](https://eightify.app/summary/web-development/the-shift-from-vercel-to-aws-amplify-cost-and-scaling-benefits) to [become](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/12t5nhi/needed_alternatives_for_vercel/) very [expensive](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/q7vw6p/cheaper_vercel_alternatives_specifically_to/hgm7d1t/) at scale (pay-per-developer + exceeded invocations/memory + exdeeded bandwidth; must have enterprise plan when >10 developers), and their pricing is [opaque](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/search?q=vercel+pricing&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on) and hard to predict (which is a turn-off, and a no-go for large enterprise customers).

You can self-host Next.js as a Node.js server, for example placed in a Docker container. But it won't work precisely the same way as on Vercel.
Furthermore, self-hosting Next.js as a Serverless or Edge application (i.e. replacing Vercel) is worse.

An illustration of the problem: [with Next.js server actions you no longer handwrite API endpoints - which means you don't have the ability to explicitly control versioning](https://twitter.com/thdxr/status/1718308244383228124). So requests from old clients can fail. Vercel solved this with their deployment infrastructure, instead of in Next.js itself. So if you use Next.js but not Vercel then you'll have to deal with this major problem yourself.

These kinds of difficulties led the open source community to make the build-script [Open-Next.js](https://open-next.js.org/), to make Serverless deployment of Next.js on generic Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms easier (specifically on AWS Lambda). It allows easier reuse/integration with any AWS back-end / account one may already have, and reduces Next.js's ties to Vercel's own platform. But that is a moving target with things breaking on every patch release / new features, [according](https://x.com/thdxr/status/1740115107005280592) to Dax (@thxdr), a person working closely with the matter.

Serverless deployment of Next.js (or Vike) outside Vercel can f.ex. be done on AWS Lambda by using the framework-agnostic toolkit [SST](https://sst.dev/). SST [attempts to replicate](https://open-next.js.org/advanced/architecture) Vercel's infrastructure on AWS, in an open-source manner. Such self-hosting has less compute costs (no middle-man; less pricey at scale) and is [potentially more performant](https://twitter.com/thdxr/status/1655617129469583360) than using Vercel. SST significantly simplifies AWS, which is otherwise a pain to deal with directly/non-programmatically. But self-hosting still comes at a cost of convenience and some engineering time.

Edge deployment with Next.js is another story. [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/next-on-pages), the most prominent edge hosting provider, uses its own V8 runtime instead of Node.js. Meaning that some Next.js apps built to run on Node.js won't immediately work on the Edge. So Next.js has an Edge Runtime toolkit/mode that uses only a subset of the Node.js API, but it has [a lot of issues](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Avercel%2Fnext.js+edge+runtime&type=issues).


### Vike

Vike is server and deployment agnostic (use any hosting provider), and built with seamless Serverless / Edge compatibility from the start.

From a server perspective, <Link text="Vike is just a middleware" href="/deploy" /> that doesn't depend on Node.js and that can run anywhere where JavaScript runs (AWS, Vercel, Cloudflare, Deno Deploy, etc.), even in the browser.

> You do need Node.js for local development, as [Vite (the local dev server and bundler-toolkit used by Vike)](https://vitejs.dev/) depends on it there. But Vite doesn't need to run its own server in production, it simply produces a bundle for production. Since Vike itself doesn't depend on Node.js when it's run in production, once your app is built, there are no dependencies on Node.js anymore. In other words: you can develop apps that don't depend on Node.js and deploy them anywhere.

To integrate Vike, you simply add Vike's middleware to your server side (Express.js, Fastify, Edge Worker, Serverless Function, etc.).

With Vike, you have full control over your server and over your deployment strategy, two of the most critical aspects of your business.


## Manual integrations

As depicted above, Vike's philosophy is that you integrate tools manually instead of being locked into decisions made by your framework. Use any tool you want, however you want.

All-in-all, Vike is less easy, but simpler. For large scale projects, simplicity is *fundamentally* more important than being "easy".

Last but not least, manual integration is fun and insightful. (Whereas fighting a framework is pesky.)


## Build your own framework

Vike is designed from the ground up to enable users to build frameworks on top of Vike.

You can build your own Next.js with only hundreds of lines of code.

> While there are many [uses cases for building your own framework](https://vike.land), the most prominent one is [building company internal frameworks](https://vike.land#scale).

We foster the proliferation of React frameworks, highly-tailored to specific use cases.


## User feedback

[From @Axxxx0n](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/158#issuecomment-934224512):

1. Blazing fast development speed powered by Vite (on-demand transpiling, native ESM).
1. Next.js has to have many examples and a whole plethora of libraries are existing just to integrate some library with Next.js because it's not trivial (for example [next-i18next](https://github.com/isaachinman/next-i18next)). With Vike, you just read the documentation of the library you want to integrate and you're good to go.
1. When new React features arrive you can start to use it right away and don't have to wait for the Next.js team to integrate it. (Streaming API, server components, suspense on server, partial hydration, etc.)
1. Next.js can't read files in `/public` directory after it was built, i.e. user uploaded images.
1. With `getServerSideProps()`, Next.js blocks client-side rendering.
1. You cannot bypass data fetching on client-side navigation ([Next.js - 	&#35;23921](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/23921)) while with Vike you're flexible and can choose what you want.
1. Next.js is really pushing the Vercel platform and is starting to show in recent feature updates. Features that align with this are getting priority while important fixes are delayed.
1. Next.js is leaning on serverless and complicates usage when you don't want it.
